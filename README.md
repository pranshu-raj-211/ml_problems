# ml_problems

This repository is a collection of problems that I stumble upon and their solutions using machine learning methods. 

Some of these are standard ML problems and exercises given in learning materials that I read while exploring new topics.
This repository contains a diverse mix of problems, ranging from standard exercises in ML to unique, real-world applications.

While this repository primarily chronicles my personal learning adventure, I welcome fellow explorers! If you've discovered an intriguing machine learning problem or have a different solution to a problem already in the repository, feel free to make a pull request.
